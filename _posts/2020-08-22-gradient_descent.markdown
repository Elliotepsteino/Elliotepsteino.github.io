This work theoretically studied convergence for a shallow neural network when trained with gradient descent. 
By using a gradient flow argument, the dynamics of the predictions were directly analyzed rather than the weights.
Convergence was proved under the condition that the neural network is polynomially over-parameterized and the least eigenvalue of a data dependent matrix is positive.
