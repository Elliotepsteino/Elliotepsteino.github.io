Work supervised by <a href="http://www.ajentzen.de/">Arnulf Jentzen</a> as part of my bachelor thesis. 
We theoretically study convergence for a shallow neural network when trained with gradient descent. 
By using a gradient flow argument, we directly analyze the dynamics of the predictions rather than the weights.
We prove convergence as long as the network is polynomially over-parameterized and the least eigenvalue of a data dependent matrix is positive.
