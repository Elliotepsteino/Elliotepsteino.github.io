During a 6-month internship at EDF trading, I developed a models in Python to predict the direction of the next trade of day ahead gas futures with over 70 percent accuracy using LOB data and an ensemble of LSTM networks trained on multiple GPUs in the cloud.
I also built a web application to display real time predictions from neural network and random forest models to predict the 15-minute ahead closing price of month ahead gas futures.
Further, I created an environment for trading using limit order book (LOB) data, and utilized a proximal policy optimization reinforcement learning agent to create a trading strategy for month ahead gas futures.
