              <h1>Ironman Italy 2024 - Race Report</h1>
              Elliot Epstein <br>
              <i> September, 2024</i><br>
              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>This post outlines my recent Ironman race and the training leading up to it. I also include some highlights from the time spent in Italy leading up to the race.</p>

              <br>
              <h2>Race Day Report</h2>
              <br>
              <h3>Key Facts</h3>

              <h3>Ironman Swim: 3.8 km</h3>
              <p>
                The water in the Adriatic Sea was salty and quite choppy on the day of the race.
                I swallowed salt water quite early on in the swim, which, along with the waves, left me feeling quite sick. Another thing I will practice more before next race is swimming straight in open water. 
                I got slightly off the course several times, which made the swim longer than necessary. Leading up to the swim, I was somewhat worried about my swim gear. 
                I had not tried on my wetsuit or my swim goggles, as these were bought in Italy. Thankfully, these worked without any issues.

              <h3>Ironman Ride: 180 km</h3>
              <p>
                After finishing the swim, I took a swig of water and Gatorade in the transition area. 
                The bike part felt great overall, I was thankful to not have any mechanical issues. 
                It was a quite flat course, with the only major climb up to the village Bertinoro.
                My pre-race nutrition strategy was to have 2 700ml bottles of strong carb mix on the bike at the start. 
                At the personal needs station at kilometer 88, I put 3 new bottles of strong carb mix. 
                One to drink on the spot and the two others to replace the bottles on the bike. By the time I got to the personal needs station at km 88, I still had 300ml in one of the bottles.
                So I finished the current bottle and loaded two new ones, leaving the third untouched.
                I also had 6 gels, 3 on the bike and 3 in my shirt, which I did not use. The bottles were mixed to around 700 calories per liter. 
                I felt that the drink mix was on the strong side so I drank some water as well (they have rolling aid stations where you can pick up bottles while biking). In total I drank around 500ml like this. 
                As usual in Ironman races, drafting was not allowed. 
                They had referees on motorbikes along the course to give out warnings/penalties to those who did.
                This did not seem to be too strongly enforced, as I saw large groups of the pro riders draft in tight formations.
                Towards the end of the ride, I was looking forward to start the run, as being on the same position on the bike for so long started to feel straining.

              </p>
              <br>

              <h3>Ironman Run: 42.2 km</h3>
              <p>
                The run course was 4 loops on a flat course. Each loop had 4 aid stations. 
                My nutrition strategy was fully liquid-based, with two small cups of Coca Cola at each aid station, 
                for a total of 32 cups. This coupled with 4 salt tablets (250mg each) made sure I didn't have any cramps during the race. 
                The second and third laps were the hardest, as there was still a long way to go. The fourth lap felt comparatively easier, knowing the goal was so close.
                Looking back, I was a bit low on energy, consuming a few gels during the run would have been helpful.

              <h3>Gear List</h3>
              <p>
                Racing an Ironman requires a lot of gear, here I list the gear I used.
                Bike gear:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Bike (Giant Carbon 2013)</li>
                <li>SPD pedals</li>
                <li>Aerobars</li>
                <li>5 700ml bike bottles</li>
                <li>Flat change kit (CO2, tube, etc.)</li>
                <li>Helmet</li>
                <li>Bike gloves</li>
                <li>Bike glasses</li>
                <li>Bike travel case</li>
                <li>Bike pump</li>
                <li>Bike shoes</li>
                <li>Stanford bike shirt</li>
                <li>Bib number holder</li>
                <li>Bike shorts</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                My bike setup was more basic than most people; most people had absolute top-of-the-line triathlon bikes, whereas I had a quite old road bike.
                The only run-specific item I had were a pair of Nike Pegasus shoes. I used the bike shirt and shorts for the run.
              </p>
              <p>
                Swim gear:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Wetsuit</li>
                <li>Swim goggles</li>
                <li>Ironman swim cap</li>
                <li>Swim ear plugs</li>
                <li>Towel to change in for T1</li>
              </ul>

              <br>
              <h2>Training for the race</h2>
              <br>
              <h3>Swim Training</h3>
              <p>
                Swimming was the sport I focused least on leading up to the Ironman, as the time spent on the swim portion of the race is relatively short.
                To make sure I would be able to complete the distance, I swam 6000 meters in a pool several months before the race.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Bike Training</h3>
              <p>
                My bike training had been the most consistent in the period leading up to the race. 
                During the summer I had done around 5 Ironman distance bike rides and over 10 rides longer than 100km. 
                The longest being the 331km Seattle to Portland ride.
                Most weeks I biked 5â€“10 hours. A lot of the time spent on the bike was commuting to my summer internship.
                For the training I used a Giant Specialized bike with carbon frame and Shimano components. It was from around 2013. 
                A useful add-on was getting aerobars mounted on the bike. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Run Training</h3>
              <p>
                During the summer leading up to the Ironman, I did two marathons, as I wanted to make sure I could do the distance without too much trouble. In the second marathon I got a time of 3 hours 53 minutes.
              </p>

              <br>
              <h2>Recovery</h2>
              <p>
                Despite how I felt after finishing, I didn't spend time sitting down too long but rather drank some water and went to pick up my bike and transition bags.
                During the first night I was not able to sleep much, feeling very sore.

              <br>
              <h2>Italy</h2>
              <p>
                Leading up to the race, I spent time in Italy with my girlfriend. 
                We spent time in Palermo (Sicily), Bologna, Florence, and Cervia.
                The food in the Emilia-Romagna region was likely the best food experience I have had.
                All meals we had were excellent and price-worthy.

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>
                The Emilia-Romagna region was a perfect place to spend a few weeks leading up to the race, 
                you will not find a better place to carb load with delicious pasta and pizza.  
                I am happy with how it went, considering this was my first triathlon race.
                While the race itself was tough, the training leading up to it was super fun.
              </p>
